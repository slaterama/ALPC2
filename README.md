Code to satisfy the Art & Logic Programming Challenge (Parts 2 & 3)

This project offers a solution to the Art & Logic Programming Challenge (Part 2).
This is an Android Studio project and will work when opened as a new project inside Android Studio.

See the included file "Scott_Slater_Part3.txt" for answers to the questions in the "Art & Logic Programming Challenge (parts 2 & 3)" PDF.

To avoid the need to type long command data strings into the input field, a "Select From Sample Data" button is included, which presents the four examples from the "Art & Logic Programming Challenge (parts 2 & 3)" PDF (Simple Green Line, Blue Square, Clipping at the Edge of the Drawing, etc.) as options. Selecting one of these four options will pre-populate the command data input field.
